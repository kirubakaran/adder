<h1>Running Adder</h1>

<p>Requirements: Python 3.x.  Adder has been tested under Python 3.1
  on Linux (x86 and ARM).  It <em>ought</em> to work under Windows
  (its only OS interaction is in file I/O, and it
  uses <code>os.path</code> for pathname manipulation), but I don't
  have a Windows box to test it on.  I'll test it on Mac Real Soon
  Now.
</p>

<p>At this point, Adder isn't really packaged up; you run it from the
  source tree.  If the base directory of the tree is at
  <code>/foo/bar/baz/adder</code>, add it to
  your <code>PYTHONPATH</code>
</p>

<p><code>PYTHONPATH = $PYTHONPATH:/foo/bar/baz/adder:/foo/bar/baz/adder/+modules+</code>
</p>

<p>(The <code>+modules+</code> bit is so that Python can find 
<a href="lang.html#Modules">modules
  written in Adder</a>.)
</p>

<p>To run an Adder program <code>quux.+</code>, do:
</p>

<p><code>/foo/bar/baz/adder/adder.py quux.+</code></p>

<p>The <code>adder.py</code> program is also the REPL:
</p>

<pre>
$ ./adder.py
Loading prelude...done.
> (define (fact n)
(if (< n 2)
 1
 (* n (fact (- n 1))))
)
#<FUNCTION _adder_fact_002d1031743189>
> (fact 7)
5040
> 
</pre>

<p>There are a few sample scripts in <code>.../adder/samples</code>,
  and a few modules in <code>.../adder/modules</code>.  You'll also
  want to read <a href="lang.html">the language spec</a>.
</p>
