<h1>Adder: To-Do List</h1>

<dl>
<dt>Return and yield in helper functions.</dt>
<dd>There are a few places where we use a helper function to solve the
  statement problem.  E.g., <code>(:=)</code> and
  <code>(if)</code>.  We need to worry about return
  and yield&mdash;can't translate them directly, or we'll be returning
  from the helper.
Currently working on this; tackling it by replacing with (return-from)
  and (yield-from).  Problem: these work fine for (defun); for
  (lambda), there's no name.  Add a :block arg to (lambda).  Also to
  (begin).
</dd>
<dt>Refactor <code>build</code></dt>
<dd>Too many special cases; need to move that knowledge into the
  function classes.  Ideally, this would make it easier for the
  function classes to do rewriting&mdash;it's absurd that they have to
  call each other instead of calling <code>build</code> with the lists
  they want.
</dd>
<dt>Make <code>(exec-py)</code> work as an expr.</dt>
<dd>Depends on solving the statement problem, above.
</dd>
<dt>Make <code>(-gomer-try)</code> work as an expr.</dt>
<dd>Depends on solving the statement problem, above.
</dd>
<dt>Implement (try).</dt>
<dt>Error reporting</dt>
<dd>Lots and lots of places where constraints are asserted.  Should
  all be replaced with proper error reporting.
