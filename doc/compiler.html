<h1>The Adder compiler</h1>

<p>Adder doesn't expose a compilation step, but there is a compiler
  under the hood, translating Adder to Python.  (There was an earlier
  prototype which targeted Python bytecode; but Python bytecode
  changes too quickly.  The compiler needed substantial rework to
  target Python 3.1 instead of 3.0.)
